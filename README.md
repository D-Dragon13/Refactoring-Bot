# Refactoring-Bot
Implementation of a bot that performs automatic refactorings based on the results of static code analysis or comments in pull requests. After successful refactoring, the bot creates/updates a pull request with the changes.

Learn more about the bot and how to use it in the [wiki](https://github.com/Refactoring-Bot/Refactoring-Bot/wiki).
